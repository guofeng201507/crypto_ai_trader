# Crypto AI Trader - Project Summary

## Overview
This project implements a complete cryptocurrency trading system with AI/ML capabilities. The system includes data fetching, preprocessing, strategy implementation, backtesting, risk management, and live trading execution.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Data Management
- **Data Fetcher**: Connects to cryptocurrency exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) using CCXT library
- **Preprocessor**: Cleans data, adds technical indicators, and creates features for ML models

### 2. Trading Strategies
- **Base Strategy Class**: Abstract base class for all trading strategies
- **Moving Average Crossover**: Traditional technical analysis strategy
- **RSI Strategy**: Mean reversion strategy based on Relative Strength Index

### 3. Machine Learning
- **Base Model Class**: Abstract base class for all ML models
- **LSTM Model**: Deep learning model for price prediction

### 4. Risk Management
- **Risk Manager**: Handles position sizing, stop losses, and take profits
- **Trader**: Executes trades on exchanges with paper trading simulation

### 5. Evaluation & Execution
- **Backtester**: Comprehensive backtesting engine with performance metrics
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line interface for running different modes

### 6. Utilities
- **Configuration Manager**: Handles YAML-based configuration
- **Environment Loader**: Manages environment variables and API keys
- **Logger**: Comprehensive logging system

## Features
- Real-time data fetching from multiple exchanges
- Technical analysis and feature engineering
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Backtesting framework with detailed performance metrics
- Live trading execution with paper trading simulation
- Risk management with position sizing
- Configuration management system
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Usage

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the System
```bash
# Backtesting mode
python src/main.py --mode backtest

# Training mode
python src/main.py --mode train

# Live trading mode (paper trading by default)
python src/main.py --mode live
```

## Testing
The system includes unit tests for core components:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Configuration
- API keys are stored in `.env` file (copy `.env.example`)
- System configuration in `config/config.yaml`

## Future Improvements
1. Improve ML model performance and data preprocessing
2. Add more sophisticated trading strategies
3. Implement real-time trading with WebSocket connections
4. Add more exchanges and trading pairs
5. Implement portfolio optimization
6. Add more risk management features
7. Create a web dashboard for monitoring
